## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Layout System**

   - Grid-based layout using styled-components
   - Design with fixed grid areas for different sections
   - Consistent spacing and alignment across components

2. **State Management**

   - Uses Zustand for global state management
   - Separate stores for datasources and queries
   - Selective state updates to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Caching mechanism for loaded datasources

3. **Component Structure**

   - Modular component design with clear separation of concerns
   - Reusable UI components in the `ui/` directory
   - Feature-specific components in their respective directories
   - Consistent styling using styled-components and css variables for colors

4. **Data Flow**

   - Unidirectional data flow pattern
   - Clear separation between data fetching and presentation
   - Lazy loading of datasources for optimal performance
   - Efficient data caching strategy for datasources and queries

### Zustand Data Stores

The application uses two main Zustand stores to manage state:

1. **Datasource Store** (`datasource.store.ts`)

   ```typescript
   type DatasourceStore = {
     loading: boolean;
     availableDatasources: { label: string; value: string }[];
     datasources: Record<string, Datasource>;
     selectedDatasource: Datasource | null;
     // Actions
     setSelectedDatasource: (datasource: Datasource) => void;
     setSelectedDatasourceById: (id: string) => Promise<void>;
     loadDatasource: (id: string) => Promise<Datasource>;
     addCustomDatasource: (file: File) => Promise<Datasource>;
   };
   ```

   - Manages available and loaded data sources
   - Handles data source selection and loading
   - Supports custom data source imports via CSV
   - Implements caching for loaded data sources

2. **Query Store** (`queries.store.ts`)

   ```typescript
   type QueryStore = {
     loading: boolean;
     queries: Query[];
     selectedQuery: Query | null;
     result: DataSet | null;
     executionTime: number | null;
     // Actions
     setSelectedQuery: (query: Query | null) => void;
     addQuery: (query: Query) => void;
     updateQuery: (query: Query) => void;
     runQuery: (query?: Query) => void;
     saveQuery: (query: Query) => void;
     clearSelectedQuery: () => void;
   };
   ```

   - Manages SQL queries and their execution
   - Handles query selection and results
   - Supports query saving and updating
   - Tracks query execution time
   - Includes default example queries

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (Latest LTS version recommended)
- npm package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd forsaken-site
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run scan` - Run development server with profiling tools from react-scan

## Usage

1. **Managing Data Sources**

   - Use the "Add Data Source" button to import or configure your data sources
   - View your datasource in a table view with pagination

2. **Writing Queries**

   - Use the SQL editor to write and execute queries
   - User can save queries for easy access in future using "Save Query" button
   - User can edit saved queries using the same button

3. **Viewing Results**

   - Query results are displayed in a tabular format with pagination
   - Export results to csv file using "Export" button
   - Shows a dummy execution time for query

## Performance Metrics

Key performance metrics:

![Lighthouse Score](docs/lighthouse.png)

- Chrome Devtools Lighthouse
  - **First Contentful Paint**: ~0.4 seconds
  - **Largest Contentful Paint**: ~1.4 seconds
  - **Total Blocking time**: 20ms
- `useGetPerformance` hook
  - Custom hook that uses `window.performance` API to calculate time to render a component
  - `Time to render = endTime - startTime`
  - **`App` component initial load/render time**: ~150ms
- React-Scan
  - Library which helps in profiling a react application, it continously displays frames per second and alerts any frame drops in the app
  - Application runs at constant 60FPS for the entire time, rarely dropping to 40FPS

## Performance Optimizations

- Lazily load datasources
  - We have 10 inbuilt datasources that are loading according to user demand instead of loading all of them at once on initial page load
  - After a datasource is loaded it is cached for future uses, improving performance
- Table for Large datasets
  - With the help of `react-scan`, it was clear that the app was taking major frame drops while rendering tables with many rows
  - Implemented a simple pagination mechanism to prevent rendering all rows at once, reducing re-rendering elements on the screen
- Zustand selective states
  - Again with help of `react-scan`, I came to know that `Table` component was rendering twice in "Datasource Section" due to completely unrelated state change in "Query Store"
  - To avoid this, we can access only what's needed(a function for instance) instead of entire query store which holds frequently changing state for queries that is unrelated to "Datasource Section"
